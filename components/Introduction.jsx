            The ongoing war has subjected Ukraineâ€™s population of{" "}
            <b className=" font-bold ">44 million</b> to widespread traumatic
            stress. The WHO estimates that{" "}
            <b className=" font-bold ">1 in 4 Ukrainians</b> are at risk of
            developing a severe mental health condition such as PTSD,
            depression, or anxiety as a result of the war. By healing trauma
            now, we can improve long-term mental health outcomes for millions of
            Ukrainians.{" "}
