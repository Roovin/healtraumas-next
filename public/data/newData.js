In 2003, he founded Transatlantic Partners Against AIDS (TPAA), a groundbreaking joint venture between the U.S., Russia, and Ukraine aimed at combatting the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the former Soviet Union. His exceptional leadership and close partnership with Ambassador Richard Holbrooke, who led the Global Business Coalition on HIV/AIDS (GBC), led to the merger of TPAA and GBC. The merger significantly expanded the organization’s impact and outreach."
