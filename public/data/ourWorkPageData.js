Due to the scale of the mental health crisis in Ukraine, 11 million people are projected to need psychosocial support, making solutions that maximize resources and go beyond a 1-to-1 model between patient and provider essential. With immediate applicability due to ketamine’s effectiveness and legal status, this training will have a real impact now. In the long term, the KAP group model can serve as a framework for psychedelic-assisted group therapy if psychedelic medicines become legally available in Ukraine. Following the initial pilot, the program will be scaled to more therapists, building their capacity to ultimately reach thousands with KAP.",

Children with disabilities are particularly impacted by war and were an underserved population before the conflict in Ukraine. Together with our partners at Children & War and the Yarmachenko Institute of Special Education and Psychology of the National Academy of Educational Sciences of Ukraine, this program will pilot the adapted program among a group of 60 children.",
