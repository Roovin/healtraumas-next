There are around 700,000 children with disabilities in Ukraine and over 40 million children with disabilities living in war zones globally. Children with disabilities are particularly impacted by war and were an underserved population before the conflict in Ukraine. Together with our partners at Children & War and the Yarmachenko Institute of Special Education and Psychology of the National Academy of Educational Sciences of Ukraine, this program will pilot the adapted program among a group of 60 children.",
